The down payment is paid at closing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Closing costs are the other, non-down payment costs, paid at closing or settlement.</p>\n<p>Closing costs include the total costs and fees associated with closing a loan, including property taxes, state and county fees, lender fees, and the first year&rsquo;s hazard insurance premium. &nbsp;Although closing costs can be substantial, especially for first-time homebuyers, Buyers and Sellers may negotiate for the Seller to contribute towards the Buyer&rsquo;s closing costs at settlement, depending upon the terms of the mortgage and the policy of the lender.&nbsp;</p>"
